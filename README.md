# Overview

This repository contains the implementation of **Step 10** from the [Tryton training tutorial](https://github.com/coopengo/tryton-training/wiki). 

Developed as part of the onboarding process for developers at Coopengo, this project focuses on building a library management module within the Tryton framework. 

Through this exercise, I learned how to extend Tryton functionnalities by creating a new module that introduces user management and book borrowing functionality, while reinforcing key concepts such as model extension, wizard creation, and custom search functions.

# Installation
